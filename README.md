# MatchmakingQM

In this project I downloaded matchdata of the game Heroes of the Storm using the open replay database HotsApi. I then used the data to analyse matchmaking changes in the Quick Match mode.

## Getting started

Have a look at the analyses in the Analysis folder.

## Data

As the API will give me data that contains battle.net tags for each player I will not release the data. You can make your own dataset by using the scripts I have written.
